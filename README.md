# Inverse-Iteration-and-Rayleigh-Quotient-Iteration

This repository contains two iterative algorithms for computing eigenpairs of randomly generated matrices, which were implemented for the course [Numerical High Performance Algorithms, University of Vienna, Winter Semester 2021](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=052112&semester=2021W). Various aspects were analyzed in this context, such as the efficiency of the implementations and the accuracy of the results, influences on the convergence speed, and other advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms.

## Running experiments

By running the file *random_experiments.py*, one can see the outputs of various experiments. The user can also change some variable values, where indicated in the comments (e.g. the seed value for the random numbers generator).
